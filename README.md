## Inspiration

The inspiration for Pathways came from our team's personal experiences of career transitions. We realized that making a career change can be overwhelming and daunting, especially when you don't have a clear idea of where to start or what to do next. We wanted to create a tool that could simplify the process and help people navigate their career transitions with more ease and confidence.

## What it does

We implemented a function that uses a sliding window algorithm to analyze the career paths of multiple users, identifying common career paths and calculating their average durations. This can provide valuable insights into career progression and the job market within a particular industry or company, helping individuals make more informed decisions about their career paths and assisting individuals in identifying trends and areas for improvement.

## How we built it

To build Pathways, we started with a team brainstorming session to outline the core features and functionality of the app. We then created a basic prototype and created functions with API calls thanks to React and Javascript to gather important data and align them with our userâ€™s needs. We started work on the interface and went for a simple UI that is both easy to navigate and effective to use.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the main challenges we faced was designing the matching algorithms. We needed to find a balance between providing personalized recommendations and ensuring that the recommendations were accurate and relevant. Another challenge was building the user interface in a way that was intuitive and easy to use, while also providing enough functionality to meet users' needs.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Overall, the development of Pathways was a rewarding experience that taught us a lot about the intricacies of career transitions and the power of technology to facilitate connections and learning. Our group members have all felt the desire to change our career paths, leading to our passion for this project. The feeling of creating an application that could help others through the same transitional period we have had is all the more rewarding.

## What we learned

As we started building Pathways, we learned a lot about the challenges of matching users based on their possible career transitions. We needed to design algorithms that could effectively identify common patterns in users' career trajectories and make accurate recommendations for their next steps. We also learned the importance of user privacy and security, as we wanted to ensure that users could share their experiences and connect with others without compromising their personal information.

## What's next for Pathways

Based on our experiences building Pathways, we are excited to continue improving the app and helping even more users navigate their career transitions. In the future, we would like to expand the app's functionality to include more personalized recommendations and job opportunities. We also want to increase our user base by partnering with schools and organizations that support career development. Additionally, we would want to continue learning and improving our skills as developers to ensure that Pathways remains a cutting-edge tool for career exploration and transition. Ultimately, our goal is to make the process of finding a fulfilling career path more accessible and less daunting for everyone.
